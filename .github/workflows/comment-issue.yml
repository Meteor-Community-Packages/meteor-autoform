            Thank you for submitting this issue!
            
            We, the Members of Meteor Community Packages take every issue seriously.
            Our goal is to provide long-term lifecycles for packages and keep up
            with the newest changes in Meteor and the overall NodeJs/JavaScript ecosystem.
            
            However, we contribute to these packages mostly in our free time.
            Therefore, we can't guarantee you issues to be solved within certain time.
            
            If you think this issue is trivial to solve, don't hesitate to submit
            a pull request, too! We will accompany you in the process with reviews and hints
            on how to get development set up.
            
            Please also consider sponsoring the maintainers of the package.
            If you don't know who is currently maintaining this package, just leave a comment
            and we'll let you know
