AutoForm
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aldeed/meteor-autoform.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/aldeed/meteor-autoform)

AutoForm is a Meteor package that adds UI components and helpers to easily
create basic forms with automatic insert and update events, and automatic
reactive validation. This package requires and automatically installs the
[simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) package.
You can optionally use it with the
[collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) package, which you
have to add to your app yourself.

## UPDATING TO 4.0

AutoForm 4.0 is out with support for custom input types, but also lots of compatibility breaks. Be sure to check out the [change log](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) when updating your app!

## Installation

In a Meteor app directory, enter:

```
$ meteor add aldeed:autoform
```

## Demo

[Live](http://autoform.meteor.com)

[Source](https://github.com/aldeed/autoform-demo)

## Example

Let's say you have the following Mongo.Collection instance, with schema support
provided by the collection2 package. (Adding `autoform` to your app does not add
`collection2` by default so you need to run `meteor add aldeed:collection2` for this example
to work.)

```js
Books = new Mongo.Collection("books");
Books.attachSchema(new SimpleSchema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    label: "Title",
    max: 200
  },
  author: {
    type: String,
    label: "Author"
  },
  copies: {
    type: Number,
    label: "Number of copies",
    min: 0
  },
  lastCheckedOut: {
    type: Date,
    label: "Last date this book was checked out",
    optional: true
  },
  summary: {
    type: String,
    label: "Brief summary",
    optional: true,
    max: 1000
  }
}));
```

### A Basic Insert Form

```html
<template name="insertBookForm">
  {{> quickForm collection="Books" id="insertBookForm" type="insert"}}
</template>
```

That's it! This gives you:

* An autogenerated form that uses bootstrap3 classes.
* Appropriate HTML5 fields for all keys in the "Books" collection schema.
* A submit button that gathers the entered values and inserts them into
the "Books" collection.
* Form validation based on the schema attached to the "Books" collection. By default the form
is validated when the user submits. If anything is invalid, the form is
continually re-validated on keyup (throttled) as the user fixes the issues.
* Default validation error messages that appear under the fields, and can be
customized and translated.

### A Basic Update Form

An update form is similar to an insert form, except you need to provide the
document with the original values to be updated:

```html
<template name="updateBookForm">
  {{> quickForm collection="Books" doc=this id="updateBookForm" type="update"}}
</template>
```

This example uses `doc=this`, assuming that you use something like iron:router's `data` function to set the template's data context to the book document. This is a common way to do it, but you could also use a helper function that returns the document.

### A Custom Insert Form

If you want to customize autogenerated forms for *all* forms, you can easily
do so by writing your own templates. Refer to the templates section. However,
sometimes a certain form has a complex schema or unique UI requirements, in
which case you can use `autoForm` rather than `quickForm`, allowing you to
define fields individually.

Here's an example:

```html
<template name="insertBookForm">
  {{#autoForm collection="Books" id="insertBookForm" type="insert"}}
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Add a Book</legend>
      {{> afQuickField name='title'}}
      {{> afQuickField name='author'}}
      {{> afQuickField name='summary' rows=6}}
      {{> afQuickField name='copies'}}
      {{> afQuickField name='lastCheckedOut'}}
    </fieldset>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Insert</button>
  {{/autoForm}}
</template>
```

In this example, we added `rows=6` to the "summary" field, which will cause it
to be rendered as a `textarea` instead of a normal text input field.

### Another Custom Insert Form

In the previous example of a custom insert form, we saw how `afQuickField` can
be used to render a field with simple customizations. Now let's say we need to
fully customize one of the fields. To do this, you can use the following more
specific templates and helpers:

* afFieldIsInvalid
* afFieldInput
* afFieldMessage

Here's an example:

```html
<template name="insertBookForm">
  {{#autoForm collection="Books" id="insertBookForm" type="insert"}}
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Add a Book</legend>
    {{> afQuickField name='title'}}
    {{> afQuickField name='author'}}
    {{> afQuickField name='summary' rows=6}}
    {{> afQuickField name='copies'}}
    {{> afQuickField name='lastCheckedOut'}}
    <div class="form-group {{#if afFieldIsInvalid name='cost'}}has-error{{/if}}">
      <div class="input-group">
        <span class="input-group-addon">$</span>
        {{> afFieldInput name='cost'}}
        <span class="input-group-addon">/each</span>
      </div>
      {{#if afFieldIsInvalid name='cost'}}
      <span class="help-block">{{afFieldMessage name='cost'}}</span>
      {{/if}}
    </div>
  </fieldset>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Insert</button>
  {{/autoForm}}
</template>
```

We added a `cost` field to our form and customized it to display as an input
group with add-ons.

## Component and Helper Reference

NOTE: The `afDeleteButton` component that used to be part of autoform is now available as [a separate package](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-delete-button).

### autoForm

Use this component as a block instead of `<form>` elements to wrap your form and
gain all the advantages of the autoform package.

The following attributes are recognized:

* `collection`: Required if `schema` is not set. Set to one of the following:
    * The name of a helper function (no quotation marks) that returns an
instance of `Mongo.Collection` that has a schema defined.
    * The name (in quotation marks) of a `Mongo.Collection` instance that has
a schema defined and is in the `window` namespace.
* `schema`: Required if `collection` is not set. This schema will be used to generate
and validate the form prior to submission, so you can specify this along with a
`collection` if you want to use a schema that is slightly different from
the one your collection uses. However, the final object will still have to pass
validation against the collection schema. Set to one of the following:
    * The name of a helper function (no quotation marks) that returns an
instance of `SimpleSchema`.
    * The name (in quotation marks) of a `SimpleSchema` instance that is in
the `window` namespace.
* `id`: Required. This is used as the `id` attribute on the rendered `form`
element, so it must be unique within your entire application. It's required
because we use it to set up a form-specific validation context and to preserve
input values when a "hot code push" happens.
* `doc`: Required for an update form, and must have at least an `_id` property. Pass the current document
object, retrieved with a call to `findOne()` for example. For an insert form,
you can also use this attribute to pass an object that has default form values
set (the same effect as setting a `value` attribute on each field within the form).
* `validation`: Optional. See the "Fine Tuning Validation" section.
* `template`: Optional. See the "Templates" section.
* `type`: Optional. One of "insert", "update", or "method". Setting the `type` to anything else or omitting it will call any `onSubmit` hooks, where you can do custom submission logic. If `onSubmit` does not return false or call `this.event.preventDefault()`, the browser will also submit the form. This means that you can use AutoForm to generate and validate a form but still have it POST normally to some non-Meteor HTTP endpoint.
* `meteormethod`: Optional. When `type` is "method", indicate the name of the
Meteor method in this attribute.
* `resetOnSuccess`: Optional. The form is automatically reset
for you after a successful submission action. You can skip this by setting this
attribute to `false`.
* `autosave`: Optional. Set to `true` to enable automatic form submission for a `type="update"` form. Whenever any field value changes within the form, the change will be automatically saved to the database.
* `filter`: Optional. Set to `false` for an insert or update form to skip filtering out unknown properties when cleaning the form document.
* `autoConvert`: Optional. Set to `false` for an insert or update form to skip autoconverting property values when cleaning the form document.
* `removeEmptyStrings`: Optional. Set to `false` for an insert or update form to keep empty string values when cleaning the form document.
* `trimStrings`: Optional. Set to `false` for an insert or update form to keep leading and trailing spaces for string values when cleaning the form document.
* Any additional attributes are passed along to the `<form>` element, meaning
that you can add classes, etc.

### quickForm

Use this component to generate an entire form in one line. It takes and requires
all the same attributes as `autoForm`. In addition, it recognizes the following
attributes:

* `type`: Two additional type values are supported: "readonly" and "disabled".
* `buttonClasses`: Set the class attribute for the rendered submit button. Some templates may provide a default class if you don't set this.
* `buttonContent`: The submit button content. If you don't set this, "Submit" is used. If you set this to `false`, no submit button is rendered.
* `fields`: Optional. Bind an array or specify a comma-delimited string of field
names to include. Only the listed fields (and their subfields, if any) will be
included, and they'll appear in the order you specify.
* `omitFields`: Optional. Bind an array or specify a comma-delimited string of field
names to omit from the generated form. All first-level schema fields *except* the
fields listed here (and their subfields, if any) will be included.

Any other attributes you specify will be output as attributes of the `<form>`
element, just like when using the `autoForm` component.

See [this demo](http://autoform.meteor.com/qfdetails) for examples of what happens when you specify various types of fields in the `fields` or `omitFields` attributes.

### afFieldInput

Renders an input control for the field. The type of control depends on what you set the `type` attribute to. All of the HTML5 input types plus a few more are built in. There are add-on packages that provide additional input types (widgets, UI controls).

If you don't include a `type` attribute, the following logic is used to automatically select an appropriate type:

* If you supply the `options` attribute, a `<select>` control is used. If your schema expects an array for the field, then it is a multiple-select control. If you prefer radios or checkboxes (for example, if it is a short list of options), then add `noselect=true` attribute.
* Otherwise if the schema type is `String` and you include the `rows` attribute, a `<textarea>` is used.
* Otherwise if the schema type is `Number`, `<input type="number">` is used.
* Otherwise if the schema type is `Date`, `<input type="date">` is used.
* Otherwise if the schema type is `Boolean`, the "boolean-checkbox" type is used. You may want to specify an override type of "boolean-radios" or "boolean-select" instead. If you do so, use the `trueLabel` and `falseLabel` attributes to set the labels used in the radio or select control.
* Otherwise `<input type="text">` is used.

The following attributes are recognized:

* `name`: Required. The name of the schema key this field is for.
* `template` (default="bootstrap3"): Specify the name of a different built-in or
custom theme template to use.
* `options`: An array of options objects (see below). By specifying options, you cause the generated DOM
element to be a `select` element with these options, unless you also use
`noselect`. To use the `allowedValues` from the schema as the options, set
`options="allowed"`. To specify a label to be displayed when there is no
option selected, set `firstOption="(My Select One Label)"`.
* `capitalize`: Used only when you've set `options="allowed"`. Set this to `true`
to capitalize the labels generated from `allowedValues`.
* `noselect`: Use in conjunction with `options` attribute. Set this attribute
to anything to render radios or checkboxes for the `options` instead of `select`.
* `trueLabel`: Set to the string that should be used as the label for the `true`
option for a boolean field.
* `falseLabel`: Set to the string that should be used as the label for the `false`
option for a boolean field.
*  Any additional attributes are passed along to the generated DOM element,
meaning that you can add `class`, etc. You can also use this feature to set
default values for inputs by supplying a `value` attribute.
* `placeholder`: As with other attributes, this will be passed along to the
generated DOM element, but you can also optionally do
`placeholder="schemaLabel"` to use the field label defined in the schema as
the input's placeholder value.
* Each individual input type might accept and use additional attributes.

Here's an example of passing `options` to generate a `select` field:

*html:*

```html
{{> afFieldInput name="year" options=yearOptions}}
```

*client.js:*

```js
Template.registerHelper("yearOptions", function() {
    return [
        {label: "2013", value: 2013},
        {label: "2014", value: 2014},
        {label: "2015", value: 2015}
    ];
});
```

You can also mix in optgroups. See [the demo](http://autoform.meteor.com/select).

### afFieldMessage

Accepts and requires just one attribute, `name`, which is the name of the schema key.

Outputs the user-friendly invalid reason message for the specified property, or
an empty string if the property is valid. This value updates reactively whenever
validation is performed. Refer to
[the SimpleSchema documentation](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema#customizing-validation-messages)
for information on customizing the messages.

### afFieldIsInvalid

Accepts and requires just one attribute, `name`, which is the name of the schema key.

Returns `true` if the specified key is currently invalid. This value updates 
reactively whenever validation is performed.

### afFormGroup

Just as `quickForm` renders a form in one line, `afFormGroup` renders a form
group, that is, everything related to a single field -- the label, the input,
and the error message -- in one line.

This component accepts the same attributes as `afFieldInput`.
Attributes that are prefixed with `label-` become attributes on the rendered `label` element while
any remaining attributes are forwarded to the `afFieldInput` component. You can also set `label=false` to omit the `label` element or set `label` to a string to use that text as the label text.

### afQuickField

The `afQuickField` component is a helper component that decides whether a particular key should be rendered using `afArrayField`, `afObjectField`, or `afFormGroup`, and then forwards all your attributes to the chosen component.

* When you use the `afQuickField` component for a field that is an `Object`, it is rendered using the `afObjectField` component unless you override the `type` or supply `options`.
* When you use the `afQuickField` component for a field that is an `Array`, it is rendered using the `afArrayField` component unless you override the `type` or supply `options`.
* All other keys are rendered using the `afFormGroup` component.

Refer to the "Objects and Arrays" section for additional information.

#### afQuickField Examples

```html
{{> afQuickField name='firstField' autofocus=''}}
{{> afQuickField name='weirdColors' style="color: orange" label-style="color: green"}}
{{> afQuickField name="longString" rows="5"}}
{{> afQuickField name="radioBoolean" type="boolean-radios" trueLabel="Yes" falseLabel="No"}}
{{> afQuickField name="selectBoolean" type="boolean-select" trueLabel="Yes" falseLabel="No"}}
{{> afQuickField name="optionsButNoSelect" options=numSelectOptions noselect="true"}}
{{> afQuickField name="firstOptionSelect" firstOption="(Select Something)" options=numSelectOptions}}
{{> afQuickField name="decimal" step="0.01"}}
```

### afFieldValueIs and afFieldValueContains

Use this helper with `#if` to dynamically show and hide sections of a form based on the current value of any non-array field on the form.

See [the demo](http://autoform.meteor.com/fieldvalues)

### afFieldNames

Use with `#each` to loop through all the field names for the form's schema or for an object field.

The following is roughly equivalent to a `quickForm`:

```html
{{#autoForm}}
  {{#each afFieldNames}}
    {{> afQuickField name=this options="auto"}}
  {{/each}}
{{/autoForm}}
```

Or you can provide a `name` attribute for an object field:

```html
{{#autoForm}}
  {{#each afFieldNames name="profile"}}
    {{> afQuickField name=this options="auto"}}
  {{/each}}
{{/autoForm}}
```

You can optionally pass `fields` or `omitFields` attributes to `afFieldNames`.

### afQuickFields

Render an `afQuickField` for each field in the form schema or an object field.

```html
{{#autoForm}}
  {{! These do the same thing}}
  {{#each afFieldNames name="profile"}}
    {{> afQuickField name=this options="auto"}}
  {{/each}}
  {{> afQuickFields name="profile"}}
{{/autoForm}}
```

You can optionally pass `fields` or `omitFields` attributes to `afQuickFields`.

## Objects and Arrays

Fields with type `Object` or `Array` are treated specially.

### afObjectField

When you use the `afQuickField` component for a field that is an `Object`, it is rendered using the `afObjectField` component unless you override the type or specify options. This happens by default when you use a `quickForm` for a schema that has a field of type `Object`.

The `afObjectField` component renders all of an object field's subfields together as one group. The group is labeled with the name of the object field. The actual visual representation of the group will vary based on which theme template you use. For the "bootstrap3" default template, the group appears in a panel with a heading.

### afArrayField

When you use the `afQuickField` component for a field that is an `Array`, it is rendered using the `afArrayField` component unless you override the type or specify options. This happens by default when you use a `quickForm` for a schema that has a field of type `Array`.

The `afArrayField` component renders all of an array field's array items together as one group. The group is labeled with the name of the array field. The actual visual representation of the group will vary based on which theme template you use. For the "bootstrap3" default template, the group appears in a panel with a heading.

Additionally, buttons for adding and removing array items are automatically added to the UI. This is also done by the template, which means that you can easily make your own "afArrayField" template if you don't like the default appearance of the add/remove buttons.

An `afArrayField` (or an `afQuickField` for an array) supports the additional attributes `minCount` and `maxCount`. Normally, by default, you cannot remove items below the schema-defined `minCount` and you cannot add items above the schema-defined `maxCount`. However, sometimes you don't want a minimum or maximum count defined in the schema, but you *do* want to limit the number of items on a certain form. To do this, use the `minCount` and `maxCount` attributes. Note, however, that you may *not* override the `minCount` to be less than the schema-defined `minCount`, and you may not override the `maxCount` to be more than the schema-defined `maxCount`.

An `afArrayField` (or an `afQuickField` for an array) also supports the `initialCount` attribute. Use it to override the default initial count to be something other than 1, including 0. Note that `minCount` will still always take precedence. That is, if the `minCount` is 1 and you specify `initialCount=0`, the initial count will be 1.

At the moment, the add and remove buttons disappear when you can't use them. This could be changed to make them disabled. You can do this yourself with a custom template, but if you have thoughts about how it should work out of the box, submit an issue to discuss.

### afEachArrayItem

This is a block helper that can be used to render specific content for each item in an array. It tracks the addition and removal of array item fields (or groups of fields) reactively for you. This allows you to customize the repeated array fields, remove buttons, etc. It's generally most useful within a custom `afArrayField` template. See the built-in `afArrayField` templates for example usage.

`afEachArrayItem` supports the same attributes as `afArrayField`.

### afArrayFieldIsFirstVisible and afArrayFieldIsLastVisible

These helpers must be used within an `afEachArrayItem` block and will return `true` or `false` depending on whether the current item/field in the array is the first or last visible item, respectively.

## Public API

Some public methods are exposed on the `AutoForm` object. Refer to the [API documentation](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/blob/master/api.md).

## Non-Collection Forms

If you want to use an AutoForm for a form that does not relate to a collection
(like a simple contact form that sends an e-mail), or for a form that relates
to a collection that is schemaless (for example, Meteor.users()), you can do that.

1. In client+server code, create a `SimpleSchema` instance to define the form's schema.
2. Use the `SimpleSchema` instance as the `schema` attribute of `autoForm` or `quickForm`.
3. Set up the form to be submitted properly. There are three ways to handle this:
    * Define an `onSubmit` hook for the form. Put your logic in that function and have it return `false` to prevent normal form submission.
    * Add normal form attributes like `action` and let the form do a normal browser POST after being validated.
    * Define a server method that does something with the form data. On your `autoForm` or `quickForm` set `type="method"` and `meteormethod="yourServerMethodName"`.

When you use the third option, a server method, the form data will be gathered
into a single object when the user clicks the submit button. Then that object
will be cleaned and validated against the schema on the client and passed along
to your method on the server. **You must
validate it again in your method on the server, using `check()` in combination
with `myAutoFormSchema`. This is why we create the `SimpleSchema` instance
in client+server code.**

It's also generally best to call `myAutoFormSchema.clean` for the object again
in the server method. In particular, you will definitely want to do this if
the object's schema has auto or default values so that they can be added
securely and accurately on the server.

### An Example Contact Form

*common.js:*

```js
Schema = {};
Schema.contact = new SimpleSchema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        label: "Your name",
        max: 50
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        regEx: SimpleSchema.RegEx.Email,
        label: "E-mail address"
    },
    message: {
        type: String,
        label: "Message",
        max: 1000
    }
});
```

Note that we've created an object `Schema` in which to store all of our app's schemas.

*html:*

```html
<template name="contactForm">
  {{#autoForm schema=contactFormSchema id="contactForm" type="method" meteormethod="sendEmail"}}
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Contact Us</legend>
    {{> afQuickField name="name"}}
    {{> afQuickField name="email"}}
    {{> afQuickField name="message" rows=10}}
    <div>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
      <button type="reset" class="btn btn-default">Reset</button>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
  {{/autoForm}}
</template>
```

*client.js*

```js
Template.contactForm.helpers({
  contactFormSchema: function() {
    return Schema.contact;
  }
});
```

*server.js*

```js
Meteor.methods({
  sendEmail: function(doc) {
    // Important server-side check for security and data integrity
    check(doc, Schema.contact);

    // Build the e-mail text
    var text = "Name: " + doc.name + "\n\n"
            + "Email: " + doc.email + "\n\n\n\n"
            + doc.message;

    this.unblock();

    // Send the e-mail
    Email.send({
        to: "test@example.com",
        from: doc.email,
        subject: "Website Contact Form - Message From " + doc.name,
        text: text
    });
  }
});
```

Note the call to `check()`, which will throw an error if doc doesn't
match the schema. **To reiterate, you must call `check()` in the method or perform your
own validation since a user could bypass the client side validation.** You do
not have to do any of your own validation with collection inserts or updates,
but you do have to call `check()` on the server when submitting to a Meteor method.

## Fine Tuning Validation

To control when and how fields should be validated, use the `validation`
attribute on `autoform` or `quickForm`. Supported values are:

* `none`: Do not validate any form fields at any time.
* `submit`: Validate all form fields only when the form is submitted.
* `keyup`: Validate each form field on every key press and when the user moves
the cursor off it (throttled to run at most once every 300 milliseconds). Also
validate all fields again when the form is submitted.
* `blur`: Validate each form field when the user moves the cursor off it
(throttled to run at most once every 300 milliseconds). Also validate all
fields again when the form is submitted.
* `submitThenKeyup`: __(Default)__ At first acts like the `submit` option, but after the
user attempts to submit the form and it fails validation, subsequently acts
like `keyup`.
* `submitThenBlur`: At first acts like the `submit` option, but after the
user attempts to submit the form and it fails validation, subsequently acts
like `blur`.
* `browser`: Let the browser handle validation, if supported.

__Notes:__

* For all values except "browser", the `novalidate="novalidate"` attribute
is automatically added to the rendered form.
* If you choose `keyup` validation, there is sometimes a bug in Safari where
the autofill mechanism will cause the text in the input to be selected after
each keypress. This has the effect of making it near impossible to
actually type anything because you keep "overwriting" your input. To fix this,
simply add the `autocomplete="off"` attribute to your input fields.

## Manual Validation

In addition to telling your form to validate on certain events, sometimes you
need to manually validate.

* To validate a particular field, call `AutoForm.validateField(formId, fieldName, skipEmpty)`. It returns `true` or `false` depending on the validity of the field's current value, and it also causes reactive display of any errors for that field in the UI.
* To validate a form, call `AutoForm.validateForm(formId)`. It returns `true` or `false` depending on the validity
of the current values in the entire form, and it also causes reactive display of any errors for that form in the UI.

## Resetting Validation

After a successful submission, validation is reset, ensuring that any error
messages disappear and form input values are correct. However, you may need
to reset validation for other reasons, such as when you reuse an edit form to
edit a different document. To do this, call `AutoForm.resetForm(formId)`.

## The Form Document

When the user submits an autoForm, an object that contains all of the form
data is automatically generated. If the submission action is insert or a
method call, this is a normal document object. If the submission action is
update, this is a mongo modifier with `$set` and potentially `$unset` objects.
In most cases, the object will be perfect for your needs. However, you might
find that you want to modify the object in some way. For example, you might
want to add the current user's ID to a document before it is inserted. You can
use "before" hooks or a `formToDoc` hook to do this.

### Getting Current Field Values

You can get the current values of all fields on a form at any time by passing the form `id`
to [AutoForm.getFormValues](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/blob/master/api.md#autoformgetformvaluesformidclient). This method is *not* reactive. The form must be
currently rendered for this to work.

You can get the current value of a specific field on a specific form by passing the form
`id` and field name to [AutoForm.getFieldValue](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/blob/master/api.md#autoformgetformvaluesformidclient). This method *is* reactive so it can be used in
place of the built-in `afFieldValueIs` helper to show pieces of a form based on
custom criteria about the values of other fields on the form.

## Callbacks/Hooks

To add client-side hooks and callbacks for a form, use the `AutoForm.hooks`
or `AutoForm.addHooks` method. Here's an example of `AutoForm.hooks` that shows
all the supported hooks:

```js
AutoForm.hooks({
  myFormId: {
    before: {
      insert: function(doc, template) {},
      update: function(docId, modifier, template) {},
      "methodName": function(doc, template) {}
    },
    after: {
      insert: function(error, result, template) {},
      update: function(error, result, template) {},
      "methodName": function(error, result, template) {}
    },
    // Called when form does not have a `type` attribute
    onSubmit: function(insertDoc, updateDoc, currentDoc) {},

    // Called when any operation succeeds, where operation will be
    // "insert", "update", "submit", or the method name.
    onSuccess: function(operation, result, template) {}, 

    // Called when any operation fails, where operation will be
    // "validation", "insert", "update", "submit", or the method name.
    onError: function(operation, error, template) {},
    formToDoc: function(doc, ss, formId) {},
    docToForm: function(doc, ss, formId) {},

    // Called at the beginning and end of submission, respectively.
    // This is the place to disable/enable buttons or the form,
    // show/hide a "Please wait" message, etc. If these hooks are
    // not defined, then by default the submit button is disabled
    // during submission.
    beginSubmit: function(formId, template) {},
    endSubmit: function(formId, template) {}
  }
});
```

If you want to add the same hook for multiple forms or for all forms, use the
`AutoForm.addHooks` method instead:

```js
  AutoForm.addHooks(['form1', 'form2', 'form3', 'form4'], {
    after: {
      insert: function(error, result) {
        if (error) {
          console.log("Insert Error:", error);
        } else {
          console.log("Insert Result:", result);
        }
      },
      update: function(error) {
        if (error) {
          console.log("Update Error:", error);
        } else {
          console.log("Updated!");
        }
      }
    }
  });

  AutoForm.addHooks(null, {
    onSuccess: function () {
      console.log("onSuccess on all input/update/method forms!");
    }
  });
```

Pass `true` as an optional third argument to `AutoForm.hooks` or `AutoForm.addHooks` to replace existing hooks.

```js
  AutoForm.addHooks('form1', {
    onSubmit: function () {
      console.log("Only this onSubmit");
    }
  }, true);
```

Notes:

* It's safe to call the hooks methods multiple times and even to call them for the same
form multiple times. The list of hooks is extended each time you call it, which
means that multiple hooks of the same type can run for the same form. Hooks
will run in the order in which they are added, but all form-specific hooks run
before all global hooks.
* Passing `null` as the first argument of `AutoForm.addHooks` adds global hooks, that is,
hooks that run for every form that has been created and every form that ever will be created
in the app.
* The before hooks are called just before the insert, update, or method
call. These hooks are passed the document or
modifier as gathered from the form fields. If necessary they can modify the document or modifier. These functions can perform asynchronous tasks if necessary. If asynchronicity is not needed, simply return the document or modifier, or return `false` to cancel submission. If you don't return anything, then you must call `this.result()` eventually and pass it either the document or modifier, or `false` to cancel submission. *This is run only on the client.
Therefore, you should not assume that this will always run since a devious user
could skip it.*
* The after hooks are the same as those you would normally specify as the last
argument of the `insert` or `update` methods on a Mongo.Collection or the
Meteor.call method. Notice, though, that they are passed one additional final
argument, which is the template object. One use for the template object
might be so that you can clean up certain form fields if the result was successful
or show additional error-related elements if not. This should be rarely needed unless you have complex custom controls in your form.
* Within most hooks, you can do `this.event`, `this.template`, `this.formId` (useful in a global hook), and `this.resetForm()`.
* Refer to the next sections for details about the `onSubmit`, `formToDoc`,
and `docToForm` hooks.

### onSubmit

Submitting to a server method allows you to do anything you want with the form
data on the server, but what if you want to do something with the form data on
the client? For that, you can specify an `onSubmit` hook.

```js
AutoForm.hooks({
  contactForm: {
    onSubmit: function (insertDoc, updateDoc, currentDoc) {
      if (customHandler(insertDoc)) {
        this.done();
      } else {
        this.done(new Error("Submission failed"));
      }
      return false;
    }
  }
});
```

`onSubmit` hooks are called only when your form does not have a `type` attribute.

The arguments passed to your function are as follows:

* `insertDoc`: The form input values in a document, suitable for use with insert().
This object has been cleaned and validated, but auto values and default values
have not been added to it.
* `updateDoc`: The form input values in a modifier, suitable for use with update().
This object has *not* been validated.
* `currentDoc`: The object that's currently bound to the form through the `doc` attribute

And `this` provides the following:

* A `done` method, which you must call when you are done with your custom client submission logic. This allows you to do asynchronous tasks if necessary. If you pass an `Error` object as the only argument, then any `onError` hooks will be called; otherwise, any `onSuccess` hooks will be called.
* A `resetForm` method, which you can call to reset the corresponding autoform if necessary. But this is also done automatically after all `onSubmit` hooks have called `this.done()` without error.
* The form submit event, in `event`
* The template, in `template`

If you return `false`, no further submission will happen, and it is equivalent
to calling `this.event.preventDefault()` and `this.event.stopPropagation()`. If you return anything other than `false`, the browser will submit the form.

If you use `autoValue` or `defaultValue` options, be aware that `insertDoc` and
`updateDoc` will not yet have auto or default values added to them. If you're
passing them to `insert` or `update` on a Mongo.Collection with a schema, then
there's nothing to worry about. But if you're doing something else with the
object on the client, then you might want to call `clean` to add the auto and
default values:

```js
AutoForm.hooks({
  peopleForm: {
    onSubmit: function (doc) {
      PeopleSchema.clean(doc);
      console.log("People doc with auto values", doc);
      this.done();
      return false;
    }
  }
});
```

If you're sending the objects to the server in any way, it's always best to
wait to call `clean` until you're on the server so that the auto values can be
trusted.

### formToDoc and docToForm

Specify `formToDoc` and `docToForm` hooks if you need form values in a different
format in your form versus in the mongo document. They are mainly useful if you
decide to override an input type.

*Unlike document modifications made in "before hooks", modifications made in the
`formToDoc` hooks are made every time the form is validated, which could
happen a couple times per second on the client, depending on validation mode.
The other hooks are run only right before the corresponding submission actions,
as their names imply.*

Here is an example where this feature is used to allow comma-delimited entry in
a text field but store (and validate) the values as an array:

First specify `type: [String]` in the schema. The schema should reflect what you
are actually storing.

*For the `afFieldInput` helper, don't supply the `options` attribute:*

```html
{{> afFieldInput name="tags"}}
```

When there are no options, a `<select>` element will not be generated
even though we're expecting an array.

Then in client code, add the hooks:

```js
AutoForm.hooks({
  postsForm: {
    docToForm: function(doc) {
      if (_.isArray(doc.tags)) {
        doc.tags = doc.tags.join(", ");
      }
      return doc;
    },
    formToDoc: function(doc) {
      if (typeof doc.tags === "string") {
        doc.tags = doc.tags.split(",");
      }
      return doc;
    }
  }
});
```

## Putting Field Attribute Defaults in the Schema

If you are using the `quickForm`, `afQuickField`, `afFormGroup`, `afObjectField`, or `afArrayField` components, you may find that you want to set an attribute on something generated within those templates. In most cases, you can do this by setting attribute defaults in the corresponding schema definition. Add an `autoform` property to the schema defininition, and set it to an object specifying attribute defaults. For example, to ensure a field is always rendered as a textarea, you could do this:

```js
summary: {
  type: String,
  optional: true,
  max: 2000,
  autoform: {
    rows: 10
  }
}
```

You can also set `autoform.omit` to `true` in the schema definition for a field to prevent it from ever being included in quickForms, afObjectFields, afArrayFields, etc. This is useful for autoValue properties such as `createdAt` that you know you will not want on a form.

You can set the `type` for the field in the `autoform` object in the schema, too.

You can (and in most cases, should) target your attributes to a particular component by nesting them under the component name:

```js
summary: {
  type: String,
  optional: true,
  max: 2000,
  autoform: {
    afFieldInput: {
      type: "textarea",
      rows: 10,
      class: "foo"
    }
  }
}
```

## Complex Schemas

You can use mongo dot notation to map an input to a subdocument. For example:

* If you use `{{> afFieldInput 'address.street'}}`, whatever is entered in the field will be assigned to `doc.address.street`.
* If you use `{{> afFieldInput 'addresses.1.street'}}`, whatever is entered in the field will be assigned to the `street` property of the object at index 1 in the `doc.addresses` array.

## Dates

By default, a schema field with `type: Date` will generate an input element with
`type=date`. You can override the type on each `afFieldInput` or `afQuickField`
helper if you want to use a `datetime` or `datetime-local` input instead. Here
are some tips for using each input type.

*Consider using the [moment and moment-timezone](http://momentjs.com/) libraries to make this easy.*

### type=date

* **Saving:** The user-entered value must be of the format `YYYY-MM-DD`,
and it will be saved as a `Date` object representing that
exact datetime in the UTC time zone. (Chrome and some mobile browsers provide
date pickers that set the input value to a string in this format automatically,
but users of other browsers will have to manually enter the date in the correct
format.)
* **Loading:** If you are binding an object containing `Date` objects to an update autoform
and using them in an input with `type="date"`, the date that will be used as
the value of the input is the date represented by the `Date` object
in the UTC time zone, with the time portion ignored.
* **Displaying:** To make sure that the date format you use matches what the user
expects, you should construct your display strings based on the `Date` object
in the UTC time zone. Using the `moment` library, you might do something
like this: `moment.utc(myDate).format("LL")`
* **Min/Max:** When specifying min or max values in your schema, use a `Date`
object that represents midnight on the morning of the minimum or maximum date
in the UTC time zone.

### type=datetime

*Note: Using this type of input requires that the user do all the work to convert
from the applicable time zone to the UTC time zone since the entered time is
assumed to be UTC. It's generally better to use datetime-local.*

* **Saving:** The user-entered value must be of the format `date string + "T" + 
time string + "Z"`, and it will be saved as a `Date` object representing that
exact datetime in the UTC time zone.
* **Loading:** If you are binding an object containing `Date` objects to an update autoform
and using them in an input with `type="datetime"`, the date that will be used as
the value of the input is the date and time represented by the `Date` object
in the UTC time zone.
* **Displaying:** To make sure that the date format you use matches what the user
expects, you should construct your display strings based on the `Date` object
in the UTC time zone, or indicate on screen which time zone you are displaying.
Using the `moment` library, you might do something like this: `moment.utc(myDate).format("LLLL")`
* **Min/Max:** When specifying min or max values in your schema, use a `Date`
object that represents the exact minimum or maximum date and time
in the UTC time zone.

### type=datetime-local

* **Saving:** If you use an input with `type="datetime-local"`, the datetime string that is entered will be assumed to be in the client's local timezone. To use a different specific timezone, add a `moment-timezone` package to your app and specify a `timezoneId` attribute on the `afFieldInput` or `afFormGroup` helper.
Set this attribute to a timezone ID that moment-timezone understands, such as "America/Los_Angeles". For example, if you use an input with `type="datetime-local"` in a form
in which a user is setting up a meeting, you would need to previously determine
the time zone in which the meeting will take place. When generating the autoform
field, set the `timezoneId` attribute to the ID for this time zone.
(Chrome and some mobile browsers provide
datetime pickers that set the input value to a string in the expected format automatically,
but users of other browsers will have to manually enter the datetime in the correct
format, which is `date string + "T" + time string`.)
* **Loading:** If you are binding an object containing `Date` objects to an update autoform
and using them in an input with `type="datetime-local"`, be sure to set the
`timezoneId` attribute on the component to the time zone ID that applies. This will
ensure that the date and time you expect are shown in the input element.
* **Displaying:** Before displaying the saved date, determine the equivalent
date and time in the corresponding time zone. The easiest way to do this is
using `moment(myDate).tz(timezoneId).format()`
from the `moment` and `moment-timezone` packages/libraries.
* **Min/Max:** When specifying min or max values in your schema, use a `Date`
object that represents the exact minimum or maximum date and time
in the corresponding time zone. This may mean returning the min or max value
from a function based on a time zone ID you are storing elsewhere.

## Theme Templates

AutoForm has a robust and extendable template system. The following templates are built in:

* `bootstrap3`: Default. UI elements will be generated using Bootstrap 3 structure
and classes.
* `bootstrap3-horizontal`: Can be used with `afFormGroup` or `afQuickField` or `quickForm` only. Generates markup and
classes necessary to make the form appear with labels aligned horizontally with the fields.
In additional to setting `template="bootstrap3-horizontal"` on your `afQuickField`, you must
also define the column classes to use, for example, `{{> afQuickField name="name" template="bootstrap3-horizontal" label-class="col-sm-3" input-col-class="col-sm-9"}}` or `{{> quickForm schema=Schemas.ContactForm id="contactForm" type="method" meteormethod="sendEmail" template="bootstrap3-horizontal" label-class="col-sm-3" input-col-class="col-sm-9"}}`.
* `plain`: UI elements will be generated with no particular UI framework in mind.
(You can of course add your own classes to customize.)
* `plain-fieldset`: Can be used with `quickForm` only. Wraps the form in a
`fieldset`. Additionally allows a `label` attribute that determines what the
fieldset label should be.

### Using a Different Template

The AutoForm components can be generated using a specific template by
providing a template name as the `template` option. In addition, you
can change the default template for all components or for a particular
component type at any time:

```js
AutoForm.setDefaultTemplate('plain');

//OR

AutoForm.setDefaultTemplateForType('quickForm', 'plain-fieldset');
```

These methods are reactive, meaning that as soon as you call them, you'll
instantly see all visible forms change, if they're using the defaults.

Here's the list of possible types you can use for the first argument of
`setDefaultTemplateForType`:

* quickForm
* afFormGroup
* afObjectField
* afArrayField
* Any custom or built-in input type template name

### Creating a Custom Template

To define a custom template that is recognized by the AutoForm
templates system, simply create a template with the name
`afType + "_" + templateName`. For example, if I want to define a template
named "nothing" that can be used by a `quickForm` to generate nothing:

```html
<template name="quickForm_nothing">
</template>
```

And then use it like this:

```html
{{> quickForm schema=mySchema id="nothingForm" template="nothing"}}
```

Or tell all quickForms to use it:

```js
AutoForm.setDefaultTemplateForType('quickForm', 'nothing');
```

Obviously a real example would be a bit more complex. Your template will have
access to certain built-in helpers and properties in the data context, and you can
use those to generate what you need in the format you need it. In practice,
it is easiest to start by duplicating one of the built-in templates and then
modify your copy as necessary.

If you create a good set of templates for a commonly used framework or a
common purpose, consider releasing it as a separate add-on package. The goal
is to keep the built-in templates minimal but to provide many others through
separate packages.

## Defining Custom Input Types

Making a custom input type (form widget) is easy.

1. Create a template and any necessary helpers for it.
2. Call `AutoForm.addInputType` to give your new type a name and provide a few other necessary details.

`AutoForm.addInputType` accepts two arguments: `name` and `options`. The `name` argument defines the string that will need to be used as the value of the `type` attribute for `afFieldInput`. The `options` argument is an object with some of the following properties:

* `template`: Required. The name of the template to use, which you've defined in a `.html` file.
* `valueIn`: Optional. A function that adjusts the initial value of the field, which is then available in your template as `this.value`. You could use this, for example, to change a `Date` object to a string representing the date. You could also use a helper in your template to achieve the same result.
* `valueOut`: Required. A function that AutoForm calls when it wants to know what the current value stored in your widget is. In this function, `this` is the jQuery object representing the element that has the `data-schema-key` attribute in your custom template. So, for example, in a simple case your `valueOut` function might just do `return this.val()`.
* `valueConverters`: Optional. An object that defines converters for one or more schema types. Generally you will use `valueOut` to return a value for the most common or logical schema type, and then define one or more converter functions here. The converters receive the `valueOut` value as an argument and should then return either the same value or a type converted/adjusted variation of it. The possible converter keys are: "string", "stringArray", "number", "numberArray", "boolean", "booleanArray", "date", and "dateArray". Refer to the built-in type definitions for examples.
* `contextAdjust`: Optional. A function that adjusts the context object that your custom template receives. That is, this function accepts an object argument, potentially modifies it, and then returns it. That returned object then becomes `this` in your custom template.

It's possible to use template helpers instead of `valueIn` and `contextAdjust`, but by keeping template helpers to a minimum, you make it easier for someone to override the theme template and still use your custom input type. For example, the `bootstrap3` template overrides some of the default input types to add classes and adjust markup a bit, but it does not need to redefine template helpers to make context adjustments since `valueIn` and `contextAdjust` do that.

There is nothing overly special about the HTML template you define. Check out the properties of `this` within the template to get all of the information you need to render your control. Primarily you need to use `this.value` to set the control's value and the provided attributes in `this.atts` should be passed along to one or more of the elements you generate. In particular, you must make sure that the `data-schema-key` attribute in `this.atts` is added to one of the generated elements, the one that you want to be provided as `this` in your `valueOut` function.

For more examples, see the built-in input types [here](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/tree/master/inputTypes).

## Common Questions

### Should the value of `schema` and `collection` have quotation marks around it?

It depends. If you use quotation marks, then you are telling the autoform to
"look for an object in the `window` scope with this name". So if you define
your collections at the top level of your client files and without the `var`
keyword, then you can use this trick to avoid writing helpers.

If you don't use quotation marks, then you must define a helper function with
that name and have it return the SimpleSchema or Mongo.Collection instance.

Probably the best technique for organizing your form schemas and making them
available as helpers is to add all SimpleSchema instances to a `Schemas` object
and register that object as a helper:

*common.js:*

```js
Schemas = {};

Schemas.ContactForm = new SimpleSchema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    label: "Your name",
    max: 50
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    regEx: SimpleSchema.RegEx.Email,
    label: "E-mail address"
  },
  message: {
    type: String,
    label: "Message",
    max: 1000
  }
});

//... define all schemas

```

*client.js:*

```js
Template.registerHelper("Schemas", Schemas);
```

*html:*

```html
<template name="contactForm">
  {{#autoForm schema=Schemas.ContactForm id="contactForm" type="method" meteormethod="sendEmail"}}
  <!-- etc. -->
  {{/autoForm}}
</template>
```

### Which components should I use?

Generally you should start by using a `quickForm` for every form your app needs.
Then, if the generated form does not look correct, try the following in
this order:

1. If there is something you can change or fix about the form's schema that
will cause the `quickForm` to render correctly, change it. If the form is for
a collection, you can also try using a different schema (a subset, perhaps with
stricter rules) to render the form by supplying the `schema` attribute in
addition to the `collection`.
2. If many of your forms need the same change, try writing and using a
custom template for those forms if possible.
3. Switch to using an `autoForm` with `afQuickField`s. You can then set
attributes for both inputs and labels (using `label-` prefix), omit labels
if necessary (`label=false`), and specify field-specific template overrides.
These features are typically enough to get the appearance you want.
4. If you really need something truly custom for just one field in just one
form, you can then switch to using the `afFieldInput` component directly.

### Can I reuse the same `quickForm` or `autoForm` for both inserts and updates?

Yes. Your code that flips between states should do the following in this order:

1. Change the `type` attribute's value to "insert" or "update" as appropriate,
probably by updating a reactive variable.
2. Change the `doc` attribute's value to the correct document for an update or
to `null` (or a document containing default values) for an insert, probably by
updating a reactive variable.
3. Call `AutoForm.resetForm(formId)`. This will clear any existing validation
errors for the form.

### What are the various ways I can specify options for a select, radio group, or checkbox group?

To specify options for any field, use the `options` attribute and provide an array of
objects, where each object has a `label` property and a `value` property. There are several
different ways you can do this.

#### Use allowed values array from the schema as both the label and the value

```js
{
  favoriteColor: {
    type: String,
    allowedValues: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
  }
}
```

```html
{{> afQuickField name="favoriteColor" options="allowed"}}
```

Fields generated by `quickForm` or `afObjectField` or `afArrayField` use `allowedValues` by default.

#### Set options in the schema

```js
{
  favoriteColor: {
    type: String,
    allowedValues: ['red', 'green', 'blue'],
    autoform: {
      options: [
        {label: "Red", value: "red"},
        {label: "Green", value: "green"},
        {label: "Blue", value: "blue"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```html
{{> afQuickField name="favoriteColor"}}
```

Since `autoform.options` is in the schema, that will be used instead of `allowedValues`.

#### Calculate options in the schema

```js
{
  favoriteColor: {
    type: String,
    allowedValues: ['red', 'green', 'blue'],
    autoform: {
      options: function () {
        return _.map(['red', 'green', 'blue'], function (c, i) {
          return {label: "Color " + i + ": " + c, value: c};
        });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```html
{{> afQuickField name="favoriteColor"}}
```

`autoform.options` can be a function, but it is not recalculated reactively.

#### Use a helper

```js
{
  favoriteColor: {
    type: String
  }
}

Template.myFormTemplate.helpers({
  colorOptions: function () {
    return Colors.find().map(function (c) {
      return {label: c.name, value: c._id};
    });
  }
});
```

```html
{{> afQuickField name="favoriteColor" options=colorOptions}}
```

This example provides a reactive list of colors options read from the `Colors` collection. This assumes
that you've created and populated the `Colors` collection and published the necessary colors (documents)
to the client. Although using a UI helper is ideal because it is reactive, it can't be done with a `quickForm`
or `afObjectField` or `afArrayField`, unless you make a custom template.

### Can I put HTML in my error messages?

Yes. Define your messages using one of the `SimpleSchema` methods, including
HTML elements such as `<strong>`. Then be sure to wrap your `afFieldMessage`
tags in triple stashes.

## Examples

I would like to link to examples of public sites using this in production. If you have one,
please add a link here. You can include a brief description of how you're using autoforms
on the site, too. If the code is publicly available, link to that, too.

## Troubleshooting

* While developing, be sure to call `AutoForm.debug()` in your client code to enable extra logging.
* If nothing happens when you click the submit button for your form and there are
no errors, make sure the button's type is `submit`.
